## THE TYPES OF NETWORKS

- LAN(Local Area Network)
- PAN(Personal Area Network)
- MAN(Metropolitan Area Network)
- WAN(Wide Area Network)
- SAN(Strong Area Networking)

[Types of Computer Network](https://www.guru99.com/types-of-computer-network.html)

## Internetworking
Before discussing about the terms internet, intranet and extranet, we need to discuss the term Internetwork.

An internetwork can be defined as two or more computer networks (typically Local Area Networks LAN) which are connected together, using Network Routers.

Each network in an Internetwork has its own Network Address, which is different from other networks in the Internetwork. Network Address is used to identify the networks inside an Internetwork.

Internetwork allows different users at different geographical locations of an organization to share data, resources and to communicate. Modern businesses cannot even function without Internetwork. Internet, Intranet and Extranet are different types of internetwork.

- Internet
- Intranet
- Externet

## Network architecture refers to the way network devices and services are structured to serve the connectivity needs of client devices.

- Network devices typically include switches and routers.
- Types of services include DHCP and DNS.
- Client devices comprise end-user devices, servers, and smart things.

[What is Network Architecture?](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/enterprise-networks/what-is-network-architecture.html)

>All networks face different security threats, which they need to guard against.

## TYPES OF NETWORK ARCHITECTURE
- Peer to Peer
- Client/Server Architecture
  
*All network types have unique architectures*

- Two-tier model
  
- Three-tier model
  
- Enterprise campus: modularity

- Spine and Leaf
